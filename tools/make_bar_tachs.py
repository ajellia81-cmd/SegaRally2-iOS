"""The bar graph rev counters (Impreza, Delta) as 2D replacements with a lit
state (src/video/pack2d.h): textures/2d/barras_<car>_<part>.txt from a
capture at idle (all bars off) and <..>_lit.txt from one at the rev limiter
(all bars on). Each counter is cut in two boxes (above and left of the gear
box, which has its own replacement: boxes must not overlap). The captures
come from snapshots replayed with LW_2D_CAPTURE (out/2d/barras_coche_N_*).
