// Replacements for the 2D layers below the 3D image: the sky and the other
// backdrops behind the scenery.
//
// Each of those layers is a 512x512 picture that wraps around as the game
// scrolls it. It is identified by a hash of that picture (without the
// brightness offsets of fades), so the same sky is recognised in every stage.
// F12 in the game (and --dump-textures, for every new one) saves the
// backdrops on screen as out/sky/<hash>.png; a file with the same name in
// textures/sky/ replaces it, at any square resolution (2048x2048 for 4x
// detail) and with its own alpha. The picture is drawn at full resolution
// following the game's scroll; a 512x512 reduction of it stands in for the
// layer everywhere else (the distance haze, the horizon colour).
